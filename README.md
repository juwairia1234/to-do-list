# Todo App

A simple yet functional Todo List application built with React. This app allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It provides a clean and intuitive interface for managing your daily tasks.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Allows users to add new tasks.
- **Edit Task**: Users can edit existing tasks.
- **Delete Task**: Tasks can be deleted.
- **Mark as Completed**: Tasks can be toggled between completed and pending states.
- **Responsive UI**: The app is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **useState**: React hook for managing state within components.
- **UUID**: Generates unique identifiers for each task.
- **FontAwesome**: For icons used for editing and deleting tasks.

## How It Works

- **Todo**: This component displays each individual todo item. It includes functionality to edit, delete, and toggle the completion status of tasks.
- **EditTodoForm**: This component allows users to edit an existing task. It updates the task's value after submission.
- **TodoWrapper**: This is the main component that manages the state for all tasks. It handles the addition, deletion, toggling, and editing of tasks.
